Ever
since
gRPC
was
introduced
it
became
really
popular
among
API
developer
community.
The
reason
gRPC
became
so
popular
was
its
support
for
polyglot
implementation
(server
and
client
can
be
written
in
separate
languages),
its
focus
on
the
performance
from
get
go
(gRPC
is
based
on
HTTP/2)
and
a
great
tool
set
(gRPC
use
protobuf
for
message
and
service
descriptions
and
clients
can
be
generated
automatically
without
writing
single
line
of
code).
